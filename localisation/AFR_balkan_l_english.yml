  balkan.1.t:0 "War in the Balkans!"
  balkan.1.d:0 "Today the Sofia Pact including the countries Montenegro, Serbia and Bulgaria officially declared war on the Ottoman Empire. The Casus Belli regarded by the Pact is to free all people enslaved by the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans. The Ottomans have denounced the claims of oppresion by the Sofia Pact and calls it an aggressive war with imperialistic goals. Right now no major power has responded to the statement of the Ottoman Empire, because of this low support it can be concluded that the Empire stands totally alone in this war. Further reports indicate troop movements in Greece to the Ottoman border and the French Fleet sailing to Benghazi."

  balkan.2.t:0 "Rebellion in Albania!"
  balkan.2.d:0 "An unexpected Rebellion broke out a in Albania against the Ottoman Empire. It seems like a majority of Albanians have been arming and planning this ongoing rebellion against the Ottomans for years now and decided to start it just now. While it is known that the Ottomans have problems containing their lands in the Balkans nobody thought that the next rebellion would break out in the unimportant Albania. International pressure is high on the Ottomans. The breakout of this revoulution is already a disaster for their image as a great power and the other Balkan nations become aware of how stable the Empire really is."

  balkan.3.d:0 "                                                                                                                        Everyone saw this defeat coming. The Ottomans fighting a two front war in the Balkans with less troops against Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia were destined to lose this war. After the deaths of thousands of Ottoman and Sofia Pact Soldiers the war has finally coming to an end. The old Empire issued a peace deal and accepted the loss of their balkan lands. Now they are more weakened then ever, losing all of their European lands and having almost lost a majority of their army. It would be a miracle if the Ottomans survive more then a decade."

  balkan.4.d:0 "                                                                                                                        Nobody saw this victory coming. The Ottomans fighting a two front war in the Balkans with less troops against Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia were destined to lose this war. But after brilliant strategies deployed by the Ottoman Army the Soldiers of the Sofia Pact were crushed the under the boots of the Ottomans. The Sofia Pact issued a peace deal after the fall of Belgrade and accepted the subjugations of their countries. Now, having gained controll over the Balkans again the Ottoman Empire displays its power to the other European nations . It is truly a miracle that the Ottomans survived this long."
