USS_the_federal_debate:0 "The Federal Debate"
USS_the_federal_debate_desc:0 "Although our federal government has great responsibilities in upholding the needs of the population, the great amounts of executive and legislative power it has to share with state governments and labor unions renders it unable at times to perform its job effectively."
USS_decentralized_military:0 "Decentralized Military"
USS_decentralized_military_desc:0 "Our federal army is just a token force, with the vast bulk of our forces being unorganized state militias and guards who are subject to different authorities, have no central command and lack cohesion in their training, equipment and performance."

USS_dust_bowl_desc:0 "Our country was completely unprepared for the Dust Bowl of 1933. The large-scale human displacement, fall in agricultural yield and droughts hit our people hard and since then we have failed to deal with the impacts on our supply of food. As a consequence regions of our country are almost facing food shortages and our bureaucracy and infrastructure are overwhelmed."

#### Events ####
USSA.3.d:0 "A massive heat wave has struck our country this month. Record temperatures are being reported from Ohio to Illinois, afflicting much of the Midwest and parts of the Northeast. Combined with the lack of rainfall, farmers report state-wide droughts leading to the indiscriminate death of crops and livestock. Our fledging governmental offices have, as of now, been unable to calculate the economical impacts this disaster will have, but predict that it will be substantial, and will only hurt our attempts at solving the consequences of the Dust Bowl of 1933."
USSA.4.d:0 "During a heated speech earlier this evening, the chairman of the PPA (People's Party of America), Huey Long, condemned the policies of President Emil Seidel and declared the exit of the PPA from the Socialist-Populist coalition. Despite having threatened to do so for almost a whole year, leaders of the SPA who had insisted negotiations with Long had been going smoothly were surprised by his actions. Faced by hostility from the WSF, the RV and even members of the CLP, Long will surely face a hard road ahead of him in search of votes and allies."
USSA.5.d:0 "Top officials in the SPA were approached earlier today by the CLP on the issue of Emil Seidel's supposed plans for running for president. Citing the collapse of the Socialist-Populist coalition as a sign of his incompetence, they have demanded that James H. Maurer run for candidacy instead of Emil, or any of the other aspirants. The SPA could accept their demands and abandon Emil or they could insist on him and abandon the alliance with the CLP. Alternatively, the SPA could abandon their alliance with the CLP but either pick John L. Lewis, a popular yet controversially authoritarian labor leader, or Bill Blizzard, the leader of the SPA's radical wing as candidates."
USSA.6.d:0 "After the collapse of the alliance between the SPA and the CLP, CLP party members have opted for temporarily supporting a candidacy of either Norman Thomas or Reinhold Niebuhr to the position of president, while a possiblity of a SPA-PPA alliance under a candidate other than Long undergoes negotiaton. Norman Thomas is a moderately religious minister who formerly was an influential member of the SPA, while Reinhold Niebuhr is an influential figure in Christian socialist thought."
USSA.7.d:0 "Capitalizing on the collapse of the Socialist-Populist Coalition, the Workers' Syndicalist Federation have been discussing in their latest congress on hosting their own candidate to the elections. Two possible candidates have been considered. Bill Blizzard leads the government-tolerant syndicalist faction in the Federation and seems intent on competing under a platform of government decentralization and union empowerment. Meanwhile, BIll Haywoods leads the radical Syndicalist faction and supports the abolishment of the federal government and the total transfer of authority in the USSA to the syndicates."
USSA.8.d:0 "Capitalizing on the collapse of the Socialist-Populist Coalition, the Workers' Syndicalist Federation have been discussing in their latest congress on hosting their own candidate to the elections or supporting Bill Haywood. Hosting their own candidate would mean either having Bill Blizzard, leader of the government-tolerant syndicalists, or Bill Haywood, leader of the radical syndicalists in the Federation."
USSA.9.d:0 "The SAMAA, Socialist Association of Minorities and African-Americans is a massive and ideologically diverse organization that represents the quest for rights for minorities in the USSA. They hold immense electoral and political power, being influential over roughly 15% of the electorate and winning their approval is synonymous with making a sturdy alliance with any major party. Currently, the SPA, the PPA, the CLP and the WSF have extended a hand to upholding their policies in return for support. The question now is which party SAMAA will support. Should they support the SPA, SAMAA's chairman, W.E.B DuBois will be entertained as their ticket's vice-president."
USSA.10.d:0 "The SAMAA, Socialist Association of Minorities and African-Americans is a massive and ideologically diverse organization that represents the quest for rights for minorities in the USSA. They hold immense electoral and political power, being influential over roughly 15% of the electorate and winning their approval is synonymous with making a sturdy alliance with any major party. Currently, the SPA, the PPA and the WSF have extended a hand to upholding their policies in return for support. The question now is which party SAMAA will support."
USSA.11.d:0 "The SAMAA, Socialist Association of Minorities and African-Americans is a massive and ideologically diverse organization that represents the quest for rights for minorities in the USSA. They hold immense electoral and political power, being influential over roughly 15% of the electorate and winning their approval is synonymous with making a sturdy alliance with any major party. Currently, the SPA, the PPA and the CLP have extended a hand to upholding their policies in return for support. The question now is which party SAMAA will support."
USSA.12.d:0 "After being unable to secure an alliance with SAMAA and having little support in New England and Steel Belt states, Long had seen himself more and more isolated from political actors and organizations, until three opportunities sprung up to him for securing more votes. The first is for Long to ally himself with the leader of the NSM, William Pelley - a risky decision. The second has been suggested by members of the CLP and it is for Long to give up his candidacy and serve as vice-president for Floyd B. Olson, another PPA member, under a CLP-supported PPA candidacy. The third is for Long to reach an agreement with orthodox unionists and to moderate his discourse."
USSA.13.d:0 "After being unable to secure an alliance with SAMAA and having little support in New England and Steel Belt states, Long has seen himself more and more isolated from political actors that could secure him more votes and has seen himself without alternatives other than accepting a political alliance with William Dudley Pelley and his National Social Movement or toning down his discourse and reaching an agreement with the traditional unionists."
USSA.14.d:0 "Without support from SAMAA, the CLP has been forming a rather peculiar support group consisting of union leaders, priests, activists, journalists and many others who have very specific agenda he promises in fulfilling. This has given him a political motley rather than a political alliance that will either be a major electoral success or a complete failure."
USSA.15.d:0 "Abandoned by the CLP, the PPA and SAMAA and cursed with a declining popularity, the SPA had been in a tough position until earlier this morning, when the Revolutionary Vanguard proposed them an alliance. The RV, a radical vanguardist movement, has offered to support them integrally, if James P. Cannon is given a position as vice-president of our electoral ticket. They could agree to his offer, or they could gamble and go without making political coalitions or alliances, betting on the historical popularity of Eugene V. Debs."
USSA.68.d:0 "Although failing in securing support from a number of groups and with a low popularity, Emil Seidel has successfully made a support base around himself of independent moderates who do not wish to see some of Seidel's radical and populist opponents being elected into power."
USSA.16.d:0 "The WSF's bid for the presidency has been met with a lot of overwhelming success. To solve this issue, party members have supported one of two alternatives. Either to form a bloc of journalists, union leaders, activists, among others and to make promises to further their personal agendas in return for support or to make an anti-state and anti-government deal with more radical anarchists that not necessarily support some of our economical views."
USSA.17.d:0 "Without much support for the WSF's presidential candidacy from major political actors and with a discourse unknown by large sectors of the population, party members of the WSF have begun courting and forming an anti-government and anti-state alliance with large anarchist organizations and individuals."
USSA.18.d:0 "After months of political bickering and electoral deals, the deadline for announcing the presidential tickets has been reached and all candidates have been formally confirmed. Campaigning has already begun around the country and marks the beginning of a tight and arduous political race. Who shall be victorious? We shall yet see, but it has become clear that there is no favorite."
USSA.20.d:0 "As Huey Long prepares his nation-wide campaign initiative, he has yet to formulate his ideas in his presidential candidacy in the form of a political slogan. He could use his traditional phrase - Every Comrade a Partisan, or he could either choose a broad slogan about his welfare plans or a patriotic slogan that illustrates his desire to uphold the might of the American people and nation."
USSA.21.d:0 "Floyd B. Olson has recently organized a rally as a formal start to his presidential campaign. In it, Olson is aiming to condemn and criticize one aspect of the contemporary socialist society. He could either criticize the elitism of socialist intellectuals, condemn the privileges of the All-Industrial Congress or insult the bourgeoisie of the USA."
USSA.23.d:0 "Emil Seidel has been recently approached and asked in a formal discussion hosted as part of his presidential campaign, what main project he has planned for his presidency. In his reply, he elaborated that he would...."
USSA.24.d:0 "To gain more votes and popularity, John Lewis has planned an official rally and endorsement together with a local politician. He could either meet the very moderate and pro-investment mayor of Los Angeles, the religious and militaristic Governor of Texas, the innovative Minister of Navy or Lewis' supporters in the All-Industrial Congress."
USSA.25.d:0 "Devere Allen has elaborated a plan to acquire more votes through a visit to a specific group of people. He could either visit revolution veterans, the unionists of Northeastern America or a diversity of workers' councils across the USSA."
USSA.30.d:0 "Thomas H. Maurer has begun elaborating his plans for his international policy, as to unveil them in his presidential campaign. He could either support radical and immediate revolutionary action, a realistic and pragmatic foreign policy or a somewhat isolationist approach to it all."
USSA.32.d:0 "Bill Blizzard has recently unveiled his primary electoral message during a socialist forum of debate earlier this week. His message was to...."
USSA.33.d:0 "Bill Haywood's electoral plan focuses on trying to attract votes from a number of industries by promising investment and organization in their segments of the industrial union. As such, as elections approach, he could either commit to the mining industry, the naval industry or the arms industry."
USSA.35.d:0 "Although Reinhold Niebuhr's message on religion, livelihood for the people and governmental accountability are clear, he has yet to elaborate his position on governmental interference in the affairs of people. He could either call for greater representation and autonomy of workers or for greater federal authority and centralization."
USSA.36.d:0 "During one of his rallies, Thomas Norman declared that the most important qualities that a state should provide to its people are...."

POLITICS_EMIL_SEIDEL_DESC:0 "Emil Seidel, the \"Sewer Socialist\" is former Mayor of Milwaukee, Governor of Winsconsin and Vice-President for Eugene V. Debs. Assuming power after the death of Debs in 1932, soon after Debs assumed presidential duties, Seidel has been an eager and diligent president with good intentions, yet awful outcomes. He has presided over the collapse of the USSA's administrative logistics while trying to deal with the consequences of the Dust Bowl and a rise of military tension between the USSA and the USA rump state. Although he intends to run for president in 1936, many predict he will be unable to rally the necessary support."
