USSA.3.d:0 "A massive heat wave has struck our country this month. Record temperatures are being reported from Ohio to Illinois, afflicting much of the Midwest and parts of the Northeast. Combined with the lack of rainfall, farmers report state-wide droughts leading to the indiscriminate death of crops and livestock. Our fledging governmental offices have, as of now, been unable to calculate the economical impacts this disaster will have, but predict that it will be substantial, and will only hurt our attempts at solving the consequences of the Dust Bowl of 1933."
