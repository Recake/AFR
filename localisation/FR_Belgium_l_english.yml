bel.1.t:0 "Belgium after the Great War"
bel.1.d:0 "In 1914, Germany invaded Belgium, disregarding its neutrality and pulling the United Kingdom in the war on the side of the Entente. Belgian troops were quickly overrun, but were able to entrench behind the Yser river. In occupied Belgium, the Germans pursued the Flamenpolitik, a policy directed towards the Flemish nationalists and essentially giving in to their demands. In free Belgium, King Albert led his troops behind the frontline. After the war ended this gave him a popularity boost. In the 1920 Treaty of Versailles, Belgian diplomats were able to secure territorial claims on Zeeuws-Vlaanderen and Dutch Limburg from the Netherlands. As a result, relations with the Netherlands have never been the same since. \n\nIn the 1919 Pact of Loppem, the King sat together with the Belgian politicians who stayed behind in occupied Belgium and discussed the possibility of universal suffrage for all men above the age of 21. In the next elections, universal suffrage was enacted, effectivily turning the country into a mass democracy. As an effect, several political parties had to reform their programme to attract more voters. New parties fighting for the Flemish cause were also founded and even within the traditional parties the cause was adopted. In the early 1930s this lead to the enactment of several linguistic laws which made Flanders monolingual Dutch in the administration. \n\nHowever in recent years, several far-right and far-left parties have emerged because of a growing disdain for the current political system."
bel.1.a:0 "The Belgian Lion stands strong!"
bel.2.t:0 "King Albert dies in an accident"
bel.2.d:0 "At 2 a.m. on the 18th of February, the body of King Albert was found at the base of a cliff in Marche-Les-Dames (Namur). It is presumed the King fell to his death after a climbing accident. However, the King was known to be a skilled mountaineer and many wonder if his death was an accident at all. His 35 year old son, Leopold, will now follow in his father's footsteps as King of Belgium."
bel.2.a:0 "Long live King Leopold III!"
bel.3.t:0 "Queen Astrid dies in suspicious accident"
bel.3.d:0 "With the death of King Albert only one month ago, Belgium and the royal family have been struck by disaster again. Leopold III and his wife Astrid were involved in a car crash in the Ardennes earlier this day. Leopold survived the accident, but his wife died in his arms. Police officers rushed to the scene and discovered some elements that sabotage may be the cause of the crash. Leopold III is furious and is determined to find the culprit, whatever the cost may be."
bel.3.a:0 "Start an investigation into the case."
bel.4.t:0 "Enact Krijgswet to help the investigation?"
bel.4.d:0 "If parliament were to enact the Krijgswet, the military would take over the investigation into the death of Queen Astrid. This would improve the chances of catching the culprit, but it would mean that he would probably not get a fair trial."
bel.4.a:0 "The Krijgswet passes in parliament, do everything to catch the killer."
bel.4.b:0 "The bill fails, a fair trial is too important."
bel.5.t:0 "The killer is caught"
bel.5.d:0 "With the enactment of the Krijgswet, the military quickly took over the case of Queen Astrid. Using all their resources, they were able to find the culprit. After a two day long manhunt, they caught a middle-aged man just before he could cross into Luxembourg. The man had ties to a local communist cell. He will now probably dissapear somewhere in a dark jail cell."
bel.5.a:0 "Those damn anarchists!"
bel.6.t:0 "Investigation hits dead end"
bel.6.d:0 "The investigation into the suspicious death of Queen Astrid has hit a dead end. King Leopold III is frustrated because the Krijgswet didn't pass. If it did, surely the killer would have been caught. Tensions between Leopold III and the government are now rising. Throughout the country, more and more people are expressing their sympathy for the King."
bel.6.a:0 "The nation enters a state of mourning."
bel.7.t:0 "Election results are in"
bel.7.d:0 "The results of the latest elections just came in. King Leopold III now has to form a majority government based on the new composition of parliament. The next government will determine the future of the country for the next four years, so the King's choice is of the outmost importance."
bel.7.a:0 "The King refuses to form a government!"
bel.7.b:0 "The King starts negotiations"
bel.8.t:0 "Unrest in Wallonia!"
bel.8.d:0 "The King's decision to not form a government, rooted in his frustration with the case of his wife's death, has become a major reason for unrest in Wallonia. People are going on strike and in some places they are even attacking police forces. It has come to the point where civil war is a very real possibility. Reports of communist cells taking up arms are already coming in and the army is on high alert."
bel.8.a:0 "Crush their petty rebellion!"
bel.8.b:0 "Vive la Révolution (Play as communists)"
bel.8.c:0 "Parliament deposes Leopold III and declares the Republic before war breaks out."
bel.9.t:0 "Which coalition should lead the government?"
bel.9.d:0 "The results of the latest elections were ambiguous, the three traditional parties have lost some popularity and extreme-left and -right parties are on the rise. As a result, the negotiations to form a coalition have taken much longer than expected, but have finally come to an end. A new Prime Minister will soon take the stand in Parliament and declare the new government."
bel.9.a:0 "A coalition of Catholics and Social Democrats will lead the government"
bel.9.b:0 "A coalition of Catholics, Market Liberals and Social Liberals will lead the government"
bel.9.c:0 "Other coalitions have failed and the far-right will lead a minority government"
bel.10.t:0 "Who will become Prime Minister?"
bel.10.d:0 "In the new Catholic-Social Democrat government, someone should take the role of Prime Minister. The only question is whether a member of the KP/PC or from the BWP/POB should lead the country."
bel.10.a:0 "A Social Democrat should be PM"
bel.10.b:0 "A Catholic should be PM"
bel.11.t:0 "Who will become Prime Minister?"
bel.11.d:0 "In the new Catholic-Market Liberal-Social Liberal government, someone should take the role of Prime Minister. The Catholics already gave their support for a liberal, the only question is whether it should be a market liberal from the LP/PL or a social liberal from the PP."
bel.11.a:0 "A Market Liberal should be PM"
bel.11.b:0 "A Social Liberal should be PM"
bel.12.t:0 "Who will become Prime Minister?"
bel.12.d:0 "With the far-right taking over government after the recent elections, it is a surprise they were even able to form a coalition, as they are now discussing who should be Prime Minister."
bel.12.a:0 "Staf de Clercq (VNV) should be PM"
bel.12.b:0 "Joris van Severen (Verdinaso) should be PM"
bel.12.c:0 "Léon Degrelle (PB) should be PM"
bel.13.t:0 "King Leopold summons the Prime Minister for an explanation"
bel.13.d:0 "After the investigation into his wife's death hit a dead end, the King wants an explanation from Prime Minister Paul van Zeeland. Leopold's main complaint is the failing of the Krijgswet in Parliament, as it would have solved the mystery already, if the military had taken over the case. However, Paul van Zeeland refuses to give any explanations, as the information about Queen Astrid's death is confidential."
bel.13.a:0 "Who does he think he is?"
bel.14.t:0 "A Valkist Manifesto"
bel.14.d:0 "A recently published article by Léon Degrelle has caused some controversy lately. In the article, Degrelle describes Belgium as a crosspoint between Germanic and Romance culture in what he calls the Pax Belgica, the peaceful coexistance of both cultures. He argues that this Pax Belgica is what made the region so successful on several occasions in history. He uses the example of the great Empire of Charlemagne and the Duchy of Burgundy, both powerful nations of the Middle-Ages. \n\nLéon Degrelle then went on in describing his plans to participate in the coming elections with his new party, the Parti Bourguignon. His programme consists of what best can be described as Valkism. He declares his strong aversion towards the monarchy, as for centuries it was a tool used by foreign powers and the Catholic Church to surpress the Germanic and Romance people of Belgium. Degrelle further describes progressive policies he will strive to implement if his party gets elected into office."
