MAN_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "With the Anti-Zhili Coaltion being formed in 1924 consisting of the Anhui, Kuomintang, and Fengtian, the war ended disastrously for the Zhili, resulting in a large collapse of the Clique itself. With the Fengtian Clique finally reigning supreme in Beijing, Beiyang had managed to become stable once again with the Zhili remaining a minority in the government. However the relations with the Kuomintang in the south quickly souring, the Northern Expedition against Beiyang began. While the Kuomintang saw initial success, intervention by Shanxi caused their advance to stall, forcing peace between the two biggests governments in China."

#### TOOLTIPS ####

1_MAN_tt:0 "Zhang Zuolin has been shot dead. A terrible cloud covers Fengtian, and a power struggle is about to erupt."

#### IDEAS ####

MAN_political_reform:0 "Political Modernization"
MAN_political_reform_desc:0 "While it is undeniable that Zhang Zuolin is a dictator with virtually all power centered in his position, he affords many freedoms to the people that others, especially those in other cliques, do not receive, such as a partially free press, rights to work, and religious tolerance."
MAN_antijapanese_sentiment:0 "Anti-Japanese Sentiment"
MAN_antijapanese_sentiment_desc:0 "While the government of Fengtian has to accept the intrusion of Japanese interests, and perhaps feign smiles sometimes, it is clear that the general populace of Manchuria despises the Japanese invaders. They disagree with the general government, but would stand up to any foreign threat with zealous intent. That may need to change, however..."
MAN_warlord_ubiquity:0 "Warlord Ubiquity"
MAN_warlord_ubiquity_desc:0 "Zhang Zuolin has not been a perfect ruler, but his presence at the head of our state gives hope to the people of Fengtian, one of a united China- perhaps even one free of Japanese influence. What Zhang says goes, and the people accept it fully."
MAN_middling_industry:0 "Middling Industry"
MAN_middling_industry_desc:0 "Fengtian’s industry struggles but still remains- on average- better than any other Chinese state."

#### EVENTS ####

man.2.d:0 "Over the past several months, the Zhang Council has been working to strengthen Fengtian's economy. These efforts have paid off enormously- Fengtian's economy is better than ever before! While it is still nowhere near an industrial power, it still proves the brilliance of the Zhang Council- the pre-eminent political authority in our state."
man.3.d:0 "Several socialist associations gathered over the past several days in and around Beijing, our de jure capital, to demonstrate against what they view as an unfair, exploitative, and imperialistic relationship with Japan. While actual violent protest has been rare and sporadic, it is clear that those assembled wish for the current government to be replaced with one similar to those in the socialist states of Russia or Georgia."
man.4.d:0 "The Concordia Association, the Pan-Asianist and radical political sect, has rioted across the country today! Japanese collaborators clashed with socialist and liberal elements. Several have been left dead and the city paralyzed since. While police squads descended on the riots quickly, many along the eastern countryside have come to see the riots as proof that pro-Japanese popularity is more popular than previously imagined..."
man.5.d:0 "The Concordia Association, filled with a strange mixture of scoundrels and extremists, met today on the border with old Korea. Japanese ambassors crossed and communicated with the higher-ups in the association, but what exactly the conversation entailed is not yet known. What is known is that the Concordia Association has, with this action, clearly dedicated itself to the overthrow of the current state. Who knows what might follow if they succeed."
man.6.d:0 "Amidst the political turmoil in these past weeks, it is nice to know that many of our people across the country support the Zhang administration. Although the rallies were countrywide, they were centered mostly in Beijing and Hsinking. Many spectators were wowed by the spectacles and speeches given during these speeches. Needless to say, even Zhang Zuolin was taken by surprise, not having personally expected the rally to take place, though he was more than happy to give a speech, which was met with raucous applause."
man.7.d:0 "Zhang Zuolin was shot dead today by Concordia Assocation goons! While touring the city of Beijing, China's jewel, his entourage was set upon by several Japanese collaborationists- most strangely, Zhang was in the capital that day giving a speech on the warming of relations between Fengtian and China in the coming conflict against the Zhili. The collaborators who were still on the scene were shot dead immediately, but Zhang Zuolin had already been declared dead at the scene. Fengtian descends into a strange interregnum, and without a firm and well-liked head, it is uncertain who will assume power of Manchuria..."
