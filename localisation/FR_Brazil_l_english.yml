BOL_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "History hasn't been kind to Bolivia. Struggling as its neighbours took away the little advantages it had, Bolivia has been almost perpetually in decline geopolitically. Turned numb by the repeated failures, the people of Bolivia have suffered a lot and done all they can to go forwards. A chance came during the Chaco War, when they almost defeat Paraguay in a brutal war. However, this chance of redemption was taken away by the Argentinian intervention, and now the Bolivian people can't stand this anymore. The Republic of Bolivia has to die, so the Bolivian people can rise."
COL_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "Political instability altered the political order in Colombia in the early thirties, and the Failure in the Peru-Colombian War altered the social one. Now, the old "democratic" order, and the domination of the old parties, has collapsed. Leading a union of populist and nationalistic movements, the charismatic leader Gaitán has risen and listened to the whims of the Colombian people. While a lot of instability remains after the recent takeover, now as the clouds in Colombian society seem to clear, the Colombian people will set their sights on their target, revenge."
PRU_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "Rising as a hegemon of the Andes after their military victory over Colombia, Peru seems to have everything. A succesful, growing economy, in part thanks to close ties to the British. A wide, expansive and rich land that provides them with the resources they need. A place of prestige in the South American order. However, social inequalities and political wounds still run deep, and as the Peruvian people call for greater reforms in every aspect, the Peruvian Republic might find itself fighting both external and internal enemies."

#Brazil Events
bra.1.t:0 "Brazil in 1936"
bra.1.d:0 "Since the Great War, Brazil has been able to show itself as succesful on the world stage. With a constantly growing economy, a great population, full of resources and filled with potential, everything seems to be going good for Brazil.\n\nThat's what the international observers see. But inside Brazil the feeling is very different. The ruling government, widely regarded as oligarchic and disinterested in the people, has continued for decades with the tradition of Cafe-com-leite politics, where the "democratic" government has been controlled by the influential states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais, and their oligarchic coronel patrons, that have not cared for the deep social and economical disparities in our society.\n\nA marxist insurrection in 1931 didn't help either, and the violence of it has spread a sense of anti-red sentiment amongst some of the population, who in disapproval of the decadent republic and in hate of marxism has turned to alternative populist groups spreading a message against the government.\n\nLuckily for the government, the gambit of intervening in the Chaco War to the south, preventing the growth of Argentina's influence in our vicinities has given some legitimacy to the government, that has succesfully shown Brazil as strong. Nonetheless, their support is a fraction of our nation, and it seems the seams of our republic are showing, as political polarization mantains."
bra.1.a:0 "We have to get throught this."
bra.2.t:0 "Minor strikes all over"
bra.2.d:0 "Different workers' aggrupations have declared being on strike, looking for further rights and laws to their benefit. This show of chaos has been supported directly by the PCB, that has shown an agenda of mobilizing the workers of Brazil in their support. A worrying trend."
bra.2.a:0 "We don't need this."
bra.3.t:0 "LEC reunites people in rally"
bra.3.d:0 "Founded a couple of years ago by catholic activist Plinio Correa, the Catholic Electoral League has been in the background for most of it. Pushing for the establishment of more religious policies and traditionalism in Brazilian Society, it surged in reaction to the rather liberal reforms the government implemented after the Insurrection of 31', and has accused the government of being "decadent" and "unmoral".\n\nHowever, it's strong anti-marxist attitude and being contrarian to the disliked government has found Correa's movement a growing support base recently. Today in a rally for his cause thousands of people showed up in support for the LEC. We have to keep an eye out on this."
bra.3.a:0 "I'm sure it's nothing."
bra.3.b:0 "Try to censure this event."
bra.4.t:0 "Valquismo in the south"
bra.4.d:0 "A very recent yet quickly growing group has appeared in Brazil. Headed by Gustavo Dodt Barroso, they have imported the german ideology of Valkism to our country. With a nationalist, anti-socialist rethoric, populist ideas catering to the common people, and progressive proposals catering to the young, they have found great support in our southern regions, where those with german ancestry have shown great liking to it. A rally is planned for tomorrow, in Porto Alegre, and it seems it will be their largest to date."
bra.4.a:0 "Stop the rally."
bra.4.b:0 "What's the worst that could happen?"
bra.5.t:0 "Workers' Confederation supports Collectivists"
bra.5.d:0 "In a not surprising at all move, the COB has announced their explicit support for the collectivist movements. With the support of the largest syndicates in Brazil, this may help quite a bit the Collectivist Party.\n\nNothing good for the ruling government can come out of this, for sure."
bra.5.a:0 "There is nothing we can do."
bra.5.b:0 "Penalize the COB for this political movement."
bra.6.t:0 "Tensions in the government"
bra.6.d:0 "While our internal enemies are plenty, there is still room for disunity, as members of the PR have shown discontent at how our government is handling the internal situation, blaming us on the current set of events. This kind of internal trasgression is not a good idea."
bra.6.a:0 "It's a very bad idea."
bra.7.t:0 "The divisions inside the army"
bra.7.d:0 "Serving proudly for long and helping us dissuade dissidents, the Brazilian Army has been very useful for our internal stability. However, rumours have started of potential dissidents inside the army itself, it seems some of our Generals may not like how we are handling the situation, and we need to watch our back. It has also been heard that while some support the legitimate government, they don't trust us to get out of this either. We need our army united to get through this."
bra.7.a:0 "We really do."
bra.8.t:0 "Presidential Speech"
bra.8.d:0 "In a safely guarded event, considered by many dangerous, the President Salles decided that it would be a good idea to make a speech calling for unity and support inside Brazil. While in a surprisingly nice evening, no dissidents tried to ruin the event, it attracted a smaller crowd than expected."
bra.8.a:0 "We'll get through this."
bra.10.t:0 "The London Market Crash on Brazil"
bra.10.d:0 "Awful news have arrived for our economy, as the effects of the London Stock Market Crash seem to have stopped our economic growth and hit us when we didn't need it to."
bra.10.a:0 "Let's hope it doesn't worsen things..."
bra.11.t:0 "Mass strikes begin"
bra.11.d:0 "As exports are cancelled and the industry collapses, mass strikes have began. The workers, radicalized, have taken the blame on the government and the system we have built for Brazil.\n\nIt seems memories of the insurrection are coming back to mind, let's hope another revolution attempt doesn't occur."
bra.11.a:0 "This is bad."
bra.12.t:0 "Right-Wing movements unite against government and marxism."
bra.12.d:0 "In a surprising move, in Santa Catarina, The LEC and the UVB have reunited, as well as other movements of similar veins. Claiming they must stand strong against the menace of Collectivism, in sight of the current strikes, and denouncing the republican government for our situation, an unlikely alliance has been born.\n\nTogether, they declared that they will do whatever it takes to bring to Brazil the order it needs, that the republic hasn't been able to give, and that the marxists want to take away completely."
bra.12.a:0 "This is worrying."
bra.20.t:0 "Western States reintegrate into our Country"
bra.20.d:0 "After the Civil War, our nation become extremely divided, even after the fighting ended. Now, the tensions are getting colder and we can finally look upon each others as brothers again."
bra.20.a:0 "We welcome them."
bra.21.t:0 "Southern States reintegrate into our Country"
bra.21.d:0 "After the Civil War, our nation become extremely divided, even after the fighting ended. Now, the tensions are getting colder and we can finally look upon each others as brothers again."
bra.21.a:0 "We welcome them."

bra.22.a:0 "We welcome them."
bra.23.t:0 "Eastern States reintegrate into our Country"
bra.23.d:0 "After the Civil War, our nation become extremely divided, even after the fighting ended. Now, the tensions are getting colder and we can finally look upon each others as brothers again."
bra.23.a:0 "We welcome them."
bra.24.t:0 "Eastern States reintegrate into our Country"
bra.24.d:0 "After the Civil War, our nation become extremely divided, even after the fighting ended. Now, the tensions are getting colder and we can finally look upon each others as brothers again."
bra.24.a:0 "We welcome them."
bra.25.t:0 "Western States reintegrate into our Country"
bra.25.d:0 "After the Civil War, our nation become extremely divided, even after the fighting ended. Now, the tensions are getting colder and we can finally look upon each others as brothers again."
bra.25.a:0 "We welcome them."
bra.26.t:0 "An Unexpected Betrayal?"
bra.26.d:0 "As the civil war has taken its toll on us, it has been apparent to everyone that the capabilities of our president to mantain control has been questioned. Not only by the obvious traitors, but also my our own forces. The army in particular has been shady in its loyalties.\n\nThis finally catapulted into action when this afternoon general Euclides Figueiredo showed up with an ultimatum for the president to stand down, as the military, under his lead, would take direct control of the republic's state apparatus and lead Brazil during this civil war. Not everyone seemed to support him, however."
bra.26.a:0 "The Army takes over, under Figueiredo's leadership."
bra.26.b:0 "Get rid of these traitors!"

bra.50.t:0 "The States' Rivalry"
bra.50.d:0 "Decades under political hegemony under Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais has made us forget the true nature of our republic, an union of states. Or at least, so have felt the "other" states, and have so expressed their representatives in a message to our president.\n\nWhile no one can deny that this is the case, this has left president Salles in a rather awkward position. By giving the favour to the states, he'd help sustain the stability of our nation, something which is sorely needed. But it would make Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais upset, and their hold into our political system is such that doing so would make them disrupt our government. This is not a very easy decision."
bra.50.a:0 "We need to keep true to the union."
bra.50.b:0 "The republic is working as intended."
bra.51.t:0 "Brazil's Power"
bra.51.d:0 "While our government's strong show of influence during the Chaco War has lead many to believe Brazil is strong and able, this was only a show, while our nation has been divided and unstable. As strikes and political movements radicalize inside our borders, it seems the world is slowly noticing our real status."
bra.51.a:0 "We could be so much more."
bra.52.t:0 "The Issue of Coronelism"
bra.52.d:0 "Coronelism, the great social and political influence carried by the landed coronels, has became the great issue that divides our society. Or at least, that's popularly acclaimed. The coronels themselves, as well as their allies in different government posts, would like to claim no issue exists, and our union stands strong as ever.\n\nNo matter what we believe, however, an official policy has to be taken. Should Coronelism just be considered the natural, beneficial power structure that makes Brazilian society what it is, or should we consider it as something to reform from, into a more representative model?"
bra.52.a:0 "Coronelism is not an issue."
bra.52.b:0 "Coronelism has to change."
bra.53.t:0 "Negotiations with urban workers"
bra.53.d:0 "Growing urban discontent, specially amongst the urban workers and the also growing middle class, has reached peak levels. Thus, negotiating with them, specially with strikes on the rise, might be a good idea.\n\nAssuming, of course, we manage to find a deal benefitial for both parties."
bra.53.a:0 "Give them what they want, for now."
bra.53.b:0 "It may not be beneficial for us."
bra.54.t:0 "The Worker Dilemma"

With the organization of workers in unions and syndicates, the growth of socialist and populist ideologies, and all along a rather polarized political scene, we can't grow Brazil pretending they don't exist anymore. Or so has been claimed by reformers. The government, however, remains divided towards this issue, whether should it or not be considered a matter of upmost urgency for our nation or not."

The ideal of reforming the republic into this dream is now greater than ever, as our country is divided and torn by the war, so it has been made clear whose fault is it.\n\nThis posture has been obviously rejected by the oligarchs, that blame the current chaos at the traitors that didn't follow their rule willingly. Now, with our government reformism at its peak amongst our populace and our government, it seems like the Coronels will be a stone in our path, that will have to be dealt with. Well, another stone, considering the mess we are stuck at."

bra.56.t:0 "Our Pride Betrayed"
bra.56.d:0 "The coronels, the noble and landed gentry that has lead our nation towards being the envy of many, has been betrayed. The weak reformists that sought to make the republic what it's not, and the envious states that didn't realize the best were ruling Brazil in a dign manner, divided us, causing the current chaos to drown us.\n\nSo has been proclaimed by the government, that with full support of the Coronels, has denounced the forces of change that have struck the republic. This however, has been massively unpopular with the common people, that don't empathise whatsoever with such claims."
bra.56.a:0 "We need to bring back the old order."
bra.57.t:0 "Division amongst the government"
bra.57.d:0 "As the civil war surrounds us, it seems this conflict has caused political tensions inside the structure of our legitimate government, as expected. While the war efforts are stable, a rift has been created between those that want to reform the republic, blaming the old order in our current chaos, believing that only with reform Brazil can be brough together. On the other hand, some less popular yet very much influential groups have brough the idea that it is those dreams of reform which weakened us in first place and put is our current situation.\n\nThe only thing that's clear is that no one is happy with this situation."

Not only by the obvious traitors, but also my our own forces. The army in particular has had loyalties of its own.\n\nThis finally catapulted into action when this afternoon general Euclides Figueiredo showed up with an ultimatum for the president to stand down, as the military, under his lead, would take direct control of the republic's state apparatus and lead Brazil during this civil war. Not everyone seemed to support him, however."

If we stand together, now that it is harder than ever, we can get through this, we can works toward a better tomorrow, and fix everything that is wrong. But we need your help."\n\nThus was proclaimed by president Salles this day, as in an open speech to the people, he rallied people from all social classes, although mainly the poor, to fight for the federal cause, promising long desired reforms, and hoping to at least dissuade them from joining the rebel factions that have teared us apart.

However, many are hopeful that we fall, even while not fighting us.\n\nA Partnership, however, an accord with the lower and middle classes, may be what we need to gain popular support all around. This would include several measures in empowering the lower classes and collaborating with the urban middle class.

At the very least, we can try and reverse it later. Probably."

bra.74.t:0 "Traditionalist Propaganda"
bra.74.d:0 "In a society, tradition is the heritage that binds us together, that teaches us the lessons for proper living, and making a good society. However, society has grown far too disrespectful of it, and began questioning the old order.\n\nBy implementing new propaganda measures, honoring tradition, we can get our message to more people, and thus, gain their loyalty. It seems to have worked a bit so far, at least."

bra.75.t:0 "Guarantee of Autonomy"
bra.75.d:0 "Although more central forms of rule have slowly crawled into different governments' political platforms, albeit in a very small way so far, lately the sentiment for centralization has grown immensely. The current chaos not helping the fact, due to the fact that imposing order directly has lead many otherwise almost autonomous provinces to be in a tighter leash than ever.\n\nOf course, this was always intended to be a temporary situation, and now, to ensure the full cooperation of many provinces, and, more importantly, their landlords, our government has decided to grant the protection of local autonomy even further, valid since now."

bra.77.d:0 "As we call for the Coronels help, using their expertise in fighting and experience to rally their men in our cause, further of their leaders have come to us. One of them, Ezequiel de Matos, Horácio de Matos' brother, another experienced fighter against the Marxists, has arisen with his own men to join our cause.\n\nAnd so, the influence of the Coronels in our nation increases even further."
bra.77.a:0 "We stand where we chose to."
bra.78.t:0 "Oligarchies No More!"
bra.78.d:0 "In an applauded speech today, our president [Root.GetLeader] denounced the past age of Coronelism, stating as its uncontrolled oligarchy caused the unstability and the collapse of peace in our republic. Denouncing the old order has turned safer, now that it has weakened and almost disappeared completely, it seems.\n\nAs he finished, he promised further reforms, including a new constitution, with the purpose of guaranteeing the existence of a Republic for and by the people, instead of what the United States has been so far. Time will tell if he will accomplish this."

bra.79.d:0 "As we have taken measures to diminish their influence in our society, the coronels haven't remained happy at this, and have decided to perjudicate us in revenge.\n\nBands of raider coronels, accustomed to fighting and struggling between themselves, have used their forces to raid our industrial centers, trying to hurt our productive capacities. While this is the a futile attempt, given the fate of coronelism is sealed, nonetheless this has distracted us."

bra.80.d:0 "While we have managed to stabilize our government so far by aligning with reformists members of the political scene, not everyone has been happy at this. We have received reports of angry groups of men, most likely tied to traitorous coronels, have began raiding industrial centers from the outskirts of our cities. We certainly don't need this, and it should be prudent to put a stop to this."
bra.80.a:0 "Send our forces in."
bra.80.b:0 "We need our men at the frontlines."
bra.82.t:0 "Defectors Cross Frontlines"
bra.82.d:0 "A large part of our population has felt betrayed as we have favoured the traditional order of the influential coronels. Sadly, reformist agitation keeps on weakening our nation, as those who desired a change to the political structure of our nation have decided they would find it most likely in a different side, and have began defecting to the insurgent governments we are fighting against.\n\nWhile we could allow this to just happen, we don't need them, after all, if we want to avoid our enemies getting more men on their side, we can make our soldiers vigilate the frontlines and detain any suspect defectors."

But may the Republic of Brazil live long, as we begin a period of democracy, order, and progress for our great nation."

bra.84.t:0 "Protection of Patrimony"
bra.84.d:0 "The noble landed gentlemen that have lead our nation into an age of glory and splendor, the coronels, are the true paragons of our patrimony and our traditions.\n\nTo commemorate them and their legacy, our government has had a brilliant idea, a Law of Protection of Patrimony. This law will protect the socioeconomical standing of the landed gentry, specially relevant with the rise of the urban middle class threatening their dominance. We hope this establishes a firm future for the Coronels for the time being."
bra.84.a:0 "I love our country."

bra.90.t:0 "Martial Law Declared"
bra.90.d:0 "As the political order fell into disarray, the same time as our nation did, a faction of politically motivated armed forces, lead by General Figueiredo, has taken power and began running things themselves.\n\nAs a natural part of this, Martial Law has been declared, as the new military government prepares to unite and stabilize our faltering nation, and restore the order our Republic has lost. May them succeed at this task."
bra.90.a:0 "Brazil lives on."
bra.91.t:0 "Deserters join traitorous groups"
bra.91.d:0 "As the military has stepped in and taken over to safeguard the republic, not everyone has been happy. Many have critizised this movie, claiming "democracy in Brazil is dead" and that we are not better than the other sides in our civil war. They clearly don't understand the sacrifices that must be made for the survival of the republic.\n\nThe question remains though, What to do about the deserters?"

bra.92.t:0 "Addressing the People"
bra.92.d:0 "We are standing together in tough times. When the revolutionaries with extreme ideas and impossible dreams came to haunt Brazil, striking against our people, we stood up and drove them away. When the spectre of radical nationalism, of contagious populism, and religious extremism comes to plague us, we stand up and drive them away. Now more than ever, we have reached a low point. The previous government failed time and time again to solve the issues that plagued us, and stood still as we sunk deeper and deeper into this illness, that is threatening to break our nation apart. The armed forces have always stood up for Brazil. When our enemies from the outside threatened our noble people, they did so. And now, when internal enemies threaten us, we have stood up, this is why we have considered in the best interests of the Brazilian people for the military to lead the charge against those traitors that want this country to die. Let's stand together and take back our home!\n\nSuch was the public address the president of the Junta, Euclides Figueiredo, gave earlier today. Expecting to win over the support of the people, something that the previous government wasn't able to do."

bra.93.t:0 "The Nation's Illness"
bra.93.d:0 "As we have taken over the republic's government and set ourselves at the direction of strengthening our ill nation, the question of the illness itself and what caused it has been a rather divisive political topic. Everyone looks at the widely considered corrupt oligarchic system known as Coronelism, that weakened democracy, the soul of the republic, and caused the extremist ideological opponents to rise against our beloved homeland.\n\nWhether this is the case or not, oligarchs aren't in control anymore, nor the civil government, rather, the patriotic, loyal men of our armed forces are the ones straightening our national path. But the question remains, what to do about Coronelism? The oligarchs are certainly experienced and have plenty of contacts that would help our administration. On the other hand, getting rid of them could be what our Republic truly needs."

bra.95.d:0 "As peace has returned to our war-torn country, wounds still remain, and we will rebuild. Now, however, the Junta has come to decide what will happen to the government of our republic.\n\nThe Victory in the war has proven the military as a strong, legitimate government, capable of ruling Brazil at its worst moments. Thus, the choice was rather easy. The Junta will remain in power, and shape the reconstruction of Brazil according to its ideals, as only them can guide Brazil into rebirth."
bra.95.a:0 "Braço Forte, Mão Amiga!"
bra.96.t:0 "The Transition Process"
bra.96.d:0 "With the restoration of peace to our beautiful nation, we have come weakened and wounded from the conflict.

So stated General Figueiredo earlier today, as the transition process of rebuilding democratic insitutions in Brazil is about to begin, and we can return to our intended functioning as a republic."

Being a democracy includes the fundamental principle of the people being in charge, and as such, electing their leaders.\n\nWith the civil war, and our reforms, the old order was broken, and now for the first time in our history, we can expect legitimate, democratic elections, where corruption won't choke the Brazilian people's will no more.

#some descriptions
POLITICS_CARLOS_FREILE_LARREA_DESC:0 "Ascending as president after the death of his predecessor, Neftalí Bonifaz, Carlos Freile Larrea has found himself in a difficult position, having to balance the desires of his own Party and interests, the UPN, with those of his main source of support, the National Workers' Compact, that has slowly been turning Ecuador into an ultra-conservative pseudo-syndicalist state, but not without facing the opposition of traditional power groups."
POLITICS_JuanmaFruc_DESC:0 "Bringing the Colorados to power, Presidente Fructos has to delicately know how to balance the loyalties of his party, the army, and the upset working classes."
POLITICS_BASMUNN_DESC:0 "After president Terra's ambitions put in question the strength of democracy in Uruguay, Basilio Muñoz quickly rose to challenge his rule, and became president after Terra's deposing. Now, he has to lead Uruguay as it seeks to rebuild its republican structure once again."
POLITICS_SANTOS_DOMINICI_DESC:0 "Leading the restitution of Venezuela's Democracy after Delgado Chalbaud-Cardona's Expedition brought the Catfish down, president Dominici has built an outstanding legacy. The future is uncertain, however, and Venezuela might find itself in disarray after his mandate ends."
POLITICS_ARMANDO_SALES_DESC:0 "Popular amongst the elite and one of the rising politicians in Sao Paulo, Armando Salles de Oliveira has became the president of the Brazilian Republic. His handling of the Chaco conflict has granted him all-around popularity. However, as strife once again fills the republic, it may all go down the drain."
