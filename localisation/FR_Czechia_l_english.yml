cze.50.t:0 "Strikes in the Sudetenland"
cze.50.d:0 "While we have done our part in stabilizing our nation and working towards a new age for our nation, no one has felt integrated in our recovery process since the civil war.\n\nThe Sudeten Germans, who correspond to roughly one third of our population after the Slovak left us, have become increasingly unhappy living under Czech rule, yet they are too big of a minority to ignore. Earlier today, strikes began in parts of the Sudetenland, as Sudeten German workers are unhappy with the little representation they feel they have. This has extended to the political groups, as different Sudeten German politicians and movements have given them support, and the matter of Sudeten autonomy has become an issue for our government."
cze.50.a:0 "We'll see about it."
cze.51.t:0 "Concessions for the Germans?"
cze.51.d:0 "As the strikes persist, we have come to realize giving concessions to the Sudeten workers and cooperating with their leaders might be a solution that will calm them down, specially in the face of a growing Sudeten German autonomist movement. On the other hand, giving in to their demands might end up weakening our recovering nation even more, something we clearly not need."
cze.51.a:0 "Grant them concessions."
cze.51.b:0 "They should just work."
cze.52.t:0 "The Rise of Sudeten Valkists"
cze.52.d:0 "It's no secret that the leader of the valkist regime in Germany is of Sudeten German origin. Thus, it's not a surprise that valkist ideas would grow amonst the most radical and extreme of the Sudeten Germans. Lead by known Adam Dressler's admirer Konrad Henlein (some even say that Henlein has tried to imitate Dressler's appearance), the Sudetendeutsche Volksfront has established as the most radical nationalist movement in all of the Sudetenland. Even some Sudeten German worry at this new development, as Henlein's band of thugs seems to threaten peace."
cze.52.a:0 "Oh god no."
cze.53.t:0 "The German Democratic Front"
cze.53.d:0 "As extremist groups rise and cause chaos in the Sudetenland, not everyone is happy at this. Thus, the Sudeten-Czech Democratic Front has arisen. An openly pro-autonomy movement, they represent the different Sudeten German political parties that have come to reject the newly rising extremism in the region. Certainly a group we want in our side."
cze.53.a:0 "Let's hope we can work something out."
cze.54.t:0 "Vandalism in a Polarized Sudetenland"
cze.54.d:0 "Increasingly polarized and divided, yet increasingly chaotic in a homogeneous fashion, Sudetenland has sunk into some of its darkest periods, threatening the stability of the Czech State.\n\nDifferent nationalist groups have taken to the streets to vandalize and cause chaos as they spread their message of hate and anti-czech sentiment. Meanwhile, newly revitalized the workers have taken to the streets, and even the democratic front has spread its pro-autonomy agenda all over the region. We have to do something."
cze.54.a:0 "Send military forces to pacify the streets."
cze.54.b:0 "Let's better sit it out."
cze.55.t:0 "The Language Issue"
cze.55.d:0 "It's well known that since back in the Czechoslovakia days, the Czech domination of society and government has been strong. Now, in the titular Czech State, it remains the case. Yet as the Sudeten German want to feel represented and given autonomy, the matter of Language has arisen. Rather than be forced to learn Czech, they want to be taught German in schools and be able to use it in official government matters. While this could certainly make a lot of Sudeten Germans happy, some worry this might weaken the unity of our nation."
cze.55.a:0 "Germans will be official in the Sudetenland."
cze.55.b:0 "Czech is the language of the Czech State."
cze.56.t:0 "Peace in the Sudetenland"
cze.56.d:0 "While sunk in chaos for months, the Sudetenland is finally returning to peace. As our government was able to deal with different Sudeten political actors and, through the granting of autonomies, peacify the Sudeten movement, the radical movements have shrunk almost to nill, and the Sudeten people can finally feel as integral members of our Nation. It seems stability is coming to Czechia."
cze.56.a:0 "Today, we all are Czechs."
cze.57.t:0 "A Radical Proposal"
cze.57.d:0 "Feeling unrepresented in the Czech State, and in sight of the increasing troubles and chaos that has spread through the Sudetenland, the united Sudeten movements have come to us with a proposal. As Sudetenland within Czechia doesn't seem to be working that well, they ask for a referendum. While not everyone wants to leave Czechia and join the radical regime that is Germany, a lot of Sudeten Germans do. Thus, by allowing for a referendum, we could possibly gain the legitimacy of the Sudeten German, assuming we have won their support and they vote to stay in Czechia. The downside, of course, is the chance that the Sudeten Germans decide to leave, splitting our nation even further. Certainly an intriguing choice."
cze.57.a:0 "We'll allow the referendum."
cze.57.b:0 "Czechia is one and indivisible, Sudetenland stays no matter what."
cze.58.t:0 "Sudetenland Votes to Stay"
cze.58.d:0 "It seems our good faith was rewarded, as the Sudeten German have voted in the referendum to stay as a region of Czechia, granted autonomy, of course. The Sudeten Czech Democratic Front has declared their support of this result, although the ever-shrinking radical groups have denounced it, as it seems Sudetenland has decided that they feel at home in Czechia, after all."
cze.58.a:0 "Just as it was intended to go."
cze.59.t:0 "Sudetenland in Chaos"
cze.59.d:0 "While the Democratic Front has deeply regreted our decision, it seems that we will regret it even more, as radicalized by our decision, the different Sudeten German movements have taken it to the streets, as the Sudetenland is in absolute chaos and the radical groups take over."
cze.59.a:0 "This isn't good."
cze.60.t:0 "Valkists Unilaterally Secede"
cze.60.d:0 "Leading the charge against our government, Henlein's Sudetendeutsche Volksfront and their paramilitary goons have declared their intention to secede from Czechia and join Germany. While we can only send our men to deal with them, we can only hope that Germany doesn't stirr up trouble."
cze.60.a:0 "Nobody will allow this to happen."
cze.61.t:0 "The Sudeten Crisis"
cze.61.d:0 "Czechia has fallen into disarray as the Sudetenland has descended into chaos, at the issue of the Sudeten German people, widely radicalized under valkist movements, have declared their intention to secede Czechia and join Germany.\n\nFor years now, Czechia has been our friend and we have supported them, as we did in their civil war. Now, that Germany has fallen into radical nationalism, and this crisis seems poised to strengthen Germany while weakening our hold on continental europe, standing up with Czechia and supporting them and their territorial integrity, deterring possible German aggression, seems like the most sound choice to make, although Germany won't really like it one bit."
cze.61.a:0 "We stand with the Czechs."
cze.61.b:0 "We can't support them this time."
cze.62.t:0 "French Support Czechs in Sudetenland Crisis"
cze.62.d:0 "The Vile Czechs have been exploiting and bending the rights of the German people in Sudetenland for years now. Weakened by their civil war a few years ago, the Sudeten Germans are in a stronger position than ever, and the Czech government, unwilling to compromise, as expected of Czech scum, has mishandled the situation. Now the valkists in Sudetenland, under the Sudetendeutsche Volksfront, lead by Konrad Henlein, known admired of our Führer, have decided unilaterally their intentions to secede from Czechia and reunite with the homeland. Sudetenland is the Führer's birthplace, as well, so union would be something that he very much desires.\n\nThe imperialist French, however, have decided otherwise, and in a not surprising move, have decided to openly support and defend their puppet's territorial integrity. While most likely inevitable in the future, we aren't in best position for a conflict with France just now, and we must be smart with our decisions."
cze.62.a:0 "Union is inevitable, but it will have to wait."
cze.62.b:0 "Sudetenland is German, and won't be abandoned. §R(This will lead to war with France)§!"
cze.63.t:0 "The Sudetenland Crisis"
cze.63.d:0 ""The Vile Czechs have been exploiting and bending the rights of the German people in Sudetenland for years now. Weakened by their civil war a few years ago, the Sudeten Germans are in a stronger position than ever, and the Czech government, unwilling to compromise, as expected of Czech scum, has mishandled the situation. Now the valkists in Sudetenland, under the Sudetendeutsche Volksfront, lead by Konrad Henlein, known admired of our Führer, have decided unilaterally their intentions to secede from Czechia and reunite with the homeland. Sudetenland is the Führer's birthplace, as well, so union would be something that he very much desires.\n\nIn a lucky twist, a favour of fate, maybe, the coward French, obviously afraid of conflict with us, have abandonded their puppet, instead of defending their territorial integrity, as expected. Now Czechia will have to answer to us."
cze.63.a:0 "Sudetenland has to be ours."
cze.64.t:0 "Germany comes knocking"
cze.64.d:0 "As our forces try to pacify the region that has sunk into chaos, the Sudetendeutsche Volksfront's declaration has not gone unheard. As France has declined to comment and support our integrity, thus Germany has come upon us like a vulture, demanding that, in representation to the sovereign right of the Sudeten German people, the Sudetenland be officially transferred to German rule immediately, otherwise Germany will have to compel us to comply with more forceful means.\n\nWhile we aren't ones to easily bend to threats or give up our land, it seems like we stand alone here."
cze.64.a:0 "...the Sudetenland is German."
cze.64.b:0 "Come and take it. §R(This will lead to war with Germany)§!"
cze.65.t:0 "France Supports Us"
cze.65.d:0 "In sight of the ongoing crisis, and how it dangers the territorial integrity of our nation, France has decided to stand with us, supporting our integrity fully. This will hopefully ensure that Germany doesn't try to do anything weird, at least for now."
cze.65.a:0 "Let's hope so."
cze.66.t:0 "France Abandons Us"
cze.66.d:0 "It seems that the Great War has left the French utterly afraid of the slightest threat, as in a shocking show of cowardice, the French, who were supposed to be our allies and stand with us, able declined to vocally support our national integrity and stand with us, ostensibly at fear of incurring Germany's wrath. These are dark times for the Czechs."
cze.66.a:0 "Goddamn it."
cze.67.t:0 "The Pacification of Sudetenland"
cze.67.d:0 "As our troops have marched and spread throught the Sudetenland, peace is finally returning to the region. Paramilitary groups have been arrested, and dissidents are being dealt with. Now we can only hope we can go on and leave this crisis behind, as stability can finally be found once again, now without the radical groups in power."
cze.67.a:0 "Stability? Finally?!"
cze.68.t:0 "The Language Issue"
cze.68.d:0 "As a Czech national state, the matter of Czech language being the prime one has always been known. Sadly, Sudeten Germans have't liked having to learn the language one bit, when it's the language this country runs at. While learning it is essential for integration, some consider that we might go a little oppressive in our languages policies. This is of course, absurd, but we still need to have a solid statement about our language policy."
cze.68.a:0 "German is permitted in everyday, but Czech is official for government."
cze.68.b:0 "Keep German in the houses, only Czech can be used anywhere else."
