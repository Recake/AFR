TRN_segregation:0 "Slavery and Segregation"
TRN_segregation_desc:0 "The South African Republic is a largely segregated country where white people, despite being a numerical minority have complete political and societal control over the country and are the only ones allowed to serve in specialized professions. Even amongst the white, only those who have a certain proficiency in Dutch/Afrikaans and have proven their loyalty to the republic are allowed to serve in the army and have proper political representation. This leads to our effective manpower being significantly smaller than our actual population."
TRN_burgher_mobilization:0 "Burgher Mobilization"
TRN_burgher_mobilization_desc:0 "The Boer burghers (citizens) of our nation are well aware that they are numerically outnumbered by blacks and uitlanders and that this nation walks a thin thread between utter chaos and stability. As such, all of them are more than prepared to leave their ordinary lives whenever necessary and to serve in the army for extended periods of time with a small salary and little resources. This culture of military service and the unique political structures of our nation allows us to conscript a much larger number of our citizens than other countries."
TRN_witwatersrand_gold_rush:0 "Witwatersrand Gold"
TRN_witwatersrand_gold_rush_desc:0 "Since 1886, when gold deposits were discovered in the Witwatersrand, our nation has seen an economic boom powered by the mining of gold which has become effectively our main export and largest economic asset. Even in these trying times of world economic crisis, the gold of Witwatersrand is still very valuable and alone has sustained our economy and assured we don't go bankrupt or worse, fall into the greedy hands of the British."
TRN_grey_depression:0 "Graue Depression"
TRN_grey_depression_desc:0 "The Graue Depression has rocked our nation considerably, since it afflicted heavily our two main trade partners- the British and German Empires. Now, what little of native industry we have managed to develop in the last few years has collapsed and our agriculture, which once was the pride of our people, is now gone, leaving hundreds of Boers impoverished and ruining our economy."

TRN_bureaucratic_reform:0 "Bureaucratic Reform"
TRN_bailout_boer_farmers:0 "Bailout Boer Farmers"
TRN_austerity_measures:0 "Austerity Measures"


unrest_groups:0 "Social Groups' Unrest"
unrest_groups_desc:0 "South African Republic is home to a diversity of social groups competing for power and control over the political context of the nation. Should one group be favoured over the other or one's groups demands be refused, there is bound to be unrest and consequences for the nation.\nAmong these groups are the Boers, the founders and dominant political class of the South African Republic which do not wish or intend to share power with the others, the Uitlanders, who are migrant workers or the descendants of migrant workers employed in the mines and wish for greater government participation and rights, the Randlords, who are European entrepreuners that own the local mining industry and wish for greater ties with the British and more economic opportunities and the black natives who outnumber every other group but have no central political authority and no political aims outside of not having their tribal communities invaded.\n\n§YBoers are at [?boer_unrest|%-] §YUnrest\n§YUitlanders are at [?uitlander_unrest|%-] §YUnrest\n§YRandlords are at [?randlord_unrest|%-] §YUnrest\n§YNatives are at [?natives_unrest|%-] §YUnrest"
TRN.21.d:0 "Reports have been arriving from the South African Republic, also known simply as the Transvaal Republic, that local workers have risen up after what seems to be years of lack of political representation and dire economic conditions. These workers, most who are of European or Capetonian heritage do not share the same language or political rights as the Boers who are the dominant class of Transvaal and have reportedly declared that in the absence of being given any rights or negotiative powers by the Boers, their intent now focuses on overthrowing the Transvaal government and installing an African-based socialist republic in its place, built on cooperation and rights for all minorities. With their militias now flooding Johannesburg and the Rand, things are looking more and more dire for this Boer republic."

TRN.4.t:0 "Witwatersrand Miners' Strike"
TRN.4.d:0 "It seems that a large group of miners in Witwatersrand has had enough of the treatment received from the economic and political elites of our nation and have declared a moderately-sized strike. Although not all-encompassing in size and scale, and not having direct ties to the ISL, the strike leaders, all of which are affiliated with the apolitical Transvaal Mineworkers' Union have refused any room for negotiation. As such, we have been cornered into a precarious position with only three choices: to repress them with police and, if needed, military forces which would undoubtedly anger all miners in the region, to ignore them and let the Randlords handle this issue, sparing us any trouble but also upsetting all who might be affected by the strike or to simply concede to their demands, which would definitely infuriate the affected Randlords but solve the issue quickly."
TRN.4.a:0 "They should learn their place"
TRN.4.b:0 "Let the foreigners shoot each other"
TRN.4.c:0 "Give in to their demands"



TRN.XX.t:0 "Riot in Johannesburg"
TRN.XX.d:0 "Reports have been arriving from Johannesburg that the unrest of the uitlanders, both miners and middle class, has reached a breaking point. It appears that a quarrel which began between a Boer shopkeeper and some uitlanders has culminated into open riot by a disorganized yet overwhelmingly large and furious crowd. Extensive parts of the city appear to have been completely ransacked and ruined by not only frustrated uitlanders but also infiltrated criminals and even black extremist movements like the Umkhosi Wezintaba. Infrastructure and small businesses are being hit the most, and it has become obvious that to avoid further damage, immediate action must be taken. However, more progressive politicians fear that doing so will only further anger the population and make any attempts at remedying relations with uitlanders more unfeasible."
TRN.XX.a:0 "Charge!"
TRN.XX.b:0 "We have no choice but to wait"



TRN.26.t:0 "Ossewajaers' Rally"
TRN.26.d:0 "The more radical and quasi-paramilitary wing of the Afrikanerfront, the Ossewajaers, appear to have planned a large rally in the midst of the Rand in favour of Afrikaner political domination and against foreign workers. Although claiming just to be voicing their political opinions, it appears clear that they in reality have subliminary intentions of using this rally as an opportunity to harass local uitlanders and natives, which will likely lead to confrontations in the region. However, while the logical thing would be force them to organize their rally elsewhere, the Ossewajaers have ties to important figures in Transvaal and upsetting them certainly would not be very benefitial for the current administration."
TRN.26.a:0 "Better to anger the prole than the powerful"
TRN.26.b:0 "We must assure the safety of all"



TRN.24.t:0 "Randlord Assassinated!"
TRN.24.d:0 "It appears that our nation has drawn one step closer towards its grave with the assassination of Lionel Phillips late in the evening yesterday. Possibly the most esteemed and infamous mining magnate of Transvaal, witness accounts indicate that Phillips was leaving the Witwatersrand Agricultural Society when a hooded individual came up to him and shot him twice, before quickly dashing off. As Phillips was alone, medical help came too late and he died a hour later, marking the end for one of the most powerful man in all of Africa. Although conclusive evidence has yet to be found on the perpetrator's identity, a preliminary first round of investigations has pointed to an impoverished Afrikaner as the prime suspect. Although we could allow this investigation regarding the incident to deepen, many officials in the government and police have still a lingering despise for Phillips due to his involvement in the Jameson Raid and resent having to punish an Afrikaner brother over the death of a traitorous British. Therefore, a secretive movement amongst influential Boers has begun calling for the investigation to be either completely dropped or for a suitable scapegoat to be found. However, some worry that doing so might anger some of Transvaal's most powerful mine owners."
TRN.24.a:0 "Let the man be avenged"
TRN.24.b:0 "Frame some trade unionist"
TRN.24.c:0 "He deserved this"
