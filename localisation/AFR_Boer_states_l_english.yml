TRN_segregation:0 "Baasskap and Segregation"
TRN_segregation_desc:0 "The South African Republic is a largely segregated country where white people, despite being a numerical minority have complete political and societal control over the country and are the only ones allowed to serve in specialized professions. Even amongst the white, only those who have a certain proficiency in Dutch/Afrikaans and have proven their loyalty to the republic are allowed to serve in the army and have proper political representation. This leads to our effective manpower being significantly smaller than our actual population."
TRN_burgher_mobilization:0 "Burgher Mobilization"
TRN_burgher_mobilization_desc:0 "The Boer burghers (citizens) of our nation are well aware that they are numerically outnumbered by blacks and uitlanders and that this nation walks a thin thread between utter chaos and stability. As such, all of them are more than prepared to leave their ordinary lives whenever necessary and to serve in the army for extended periods of time with a small salary and little resources. This culture of military service and the unique political structures of our nation allows us to conscript a much larger number of our citizens than other countries."
TRN_witwatersrand_gold_rush:0 "Witwatersrand Gold"
TRN_witwatersrand_gold_rush_desc:0 "Since 1886, when gold deposits were discovered in the Witwatersrand, our nation has seen an economic boom powered by the mining of gold which has become effectively our main export and largest economic asset. Even in these trying times of world economic crisis, the gold of Witwatersrand is still very valuable and alone has sustained our economy and assured we don't go bankrupt or worse, fall into the greedy hands of the British."
TRN_grey_depression:0 "Graue Depression"
TRN_grey_depression_desc:0 "The Graue Depression has rocked our nation considerably, since it afflicted heavily our two main trade partners- the British and German Empires. Now, what little of native industry we have managed to develop in the last few years has collapsed and our agriculture, which once was the pride of our people, is now gone, leaving hundreds of Boers impoverished and ruining our economy."

unrest_groups:0 "Social Groups' Unrest"
unrest_groups_desc:0 "South African Republic is home to a diversity of social groups competing for power and control over the political context of the nation. Should one group be favoured over the other or one's groups demands be refused, there is bound to be unrest and consequences for the nation.\nAmong these groups are the Boers, the founders and dominant political class of the South African Republic which do not wish or intend to share power with the others, the Uitlanders, who are migrant workers or the descendants of migrant workers employed in the mines and wish for greater government participation and rights, the Randlords, who are European entrepreuners that own the local mining industry and wish for greater ties with the British and more economic opportunities and the black natives who outnumber every other group but have no central political authority and no political aims outside of not having there tribal communities invaded.\n\n§YBoers are at [?boer_unrest|%-] §YUnrest\n§YUitlanders are at [?uitlander_unrest|%-] §YUnrest\n§YRandlords are at [?randlord_unrest|%-] §YUnrest\n§YNatives are at [?natives_unrest|%-] §YUnrest"
TRN.21.d:0 "Reports have been arriving from the South African Republic, also known simply as the Transvaal Republic, that local workers have risen up after what seems to be years of lack of political representation and dire economic conditions. These workers, most who are of European or Capetonian heritage do not share the same language or political rights as the Boers who are the dominant class of Transvaal and have reportedly declared that in the absence of being given any rights or negotiative powers by the Boers, their intent now focuses on overthrowing the Transvaal government and installing an African-based socialist republic in its place, built on cooperation and rights for all minorities. With their militias now flooding Johannesburg and the Rand, things are looking more and more dire for this Boer republic."
