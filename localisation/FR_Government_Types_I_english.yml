internationalist_subtype_desc:0 "Developed from particularly interventionist branches of revolutionary_unionism and Marxism overall, Internationalist Socialism, as it calls itself, or more commonly known as Internationalism,  is a socialist ideology that proposes the workers, once in power, must organize to enact a perpetual revolution, and to continue proactively in their struggle to bring socialism to the world. While most socialist strains are of international nature, the proactive spirit of Internationalism has given it a more militant nature, and Internationalist ideologues are known advocates of increased militarization of the workers in name of the revolution, as well as establishing a strong state that is able to defend the workers’ interests and protect the revolution from reactionary forces that may oppose it, however, these traits are just means, not ends, to Internationalists' agenda, as the revolution is never supposed to stop spreading."

vanguard_marxist_subtype_desc:0 "Vanguard Marxism is often used as a term to describe the various authoritarian interpretations of Socialism, which propose a much stronger state than which is advocated by both Libertarian Socialists and Revolutionary Unionists.

Many different sub-ideologies fall under the banner of libertarian socialism. Prominent ideologies under this term may include Participism, Communalism and Anarchism, amongst others."
###
social_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Social Democracy is an ideology whose goal is to reform capitalism and humanize it by aligning it with the ethical ideals of social welfare while maintaining the capitalist mode of production, rather than creating an alternative socialist economic system. While usually promoting a plutocratic form of government and a heavily regulated market economy, some more radical streams exist."
###
social_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Social Liberalism is a variation on mainstream Market liberalism, with the main difference being is the inclusion of various civil freedoms as basic human rights.

Nonetheless, it is normally centred on preserving traditional beliefs, attitudes and philosophy as well as the traditional power dynamic of society while using the democratic system.

Most conservative societies usually promote a regulated market economy and favour economic protectionism."
###
authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Authoritarian Democracy is an ideology that combines a strong executive power with a representative parliament and a partial democratic political system.

The aim of these regimes is to maintain national stability and provide the people both a popular and responsible government."
###
paternal_autocrat_subtype_desc:0 "Paternal Autocracy is not a political ideology in the normal sense of the word, but rather a general term for the attitude that these governments hold towards their citizens: The people are all subjects of the leader, either a king or a dictator, and it is the leader's job and duty to lead the state and society towards the righteous and best path while uniting the people of under his benevolent protection. These countries usually have a very authoritarian government, conservative social views and a state controlled economy."
###
