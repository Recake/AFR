BUL_national_populist_party_long:0 "The Bulgarian National Front\n§g After the disaster which was the Great War, the country of Bulgaria found itself more and more opposed to the monarchy of Boris III. In 1935 the conservative supportive government of the Tsar was unable to create a new government and the government was near collapse. To prevent the takeover of socialist government and bring back order to the country, the General Hristo Lukov and his fellow men executed a coup on the government and installed a new Tsar Supportive Government under controll of the military. While popularity for the coup is high in Bulgaria due to the mass mobilization against the Ottomans, the National Front of Bulgaira is split between supporting the Tsar or following the new tempting path of Fratellism."
