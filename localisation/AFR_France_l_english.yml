##Events
fra.1.d:0 "Europe may have been a rapidly changing continent for centuries, but France outshined the rest when it came to change. A multitude of changes in regimes came about in a single century, with the Third Republic being born from the turmoil incurred by the Franco-Prussian War. For a nation which had traditionally dominated the politics of mainland Europe, France had finally found herself outmatched one-on-one, and was faced with a disastrous loss. Nonetheless, the war provided France with enough experience to learn about the weak points of their nation.\n\nFrance had suffered a stagnant population growth up to the Franco-Prussian War, and their small pool of men to draw from had worsened their military staffing issues during the War. The post-war would result in the Government acknowledging this, and would then go on to encourage population growth by supporting organizations such as the National Alliance for the Growth of the French Population (ANAPF) which was formed in 1882. This has led to France being able to properly match the population growth rates of Britain and Germany, making them much more formidable economically and militarily.\n\nWith the Legimist assembly pushed out of power in 1877 thanks to their incapability of instating a Monarch, the Opportunist Republicans had once more returned to the helm of the Third Republic. Political stability would not last long, as in 1889 a man named Georges Ernest Boulanger would rise to prominence in French politics, abusing the French Electoral System by running in one region, and resigning his seat to a party member once he won. As a left-leaning populist, he garnered large portions of sympathy from the lower class in France, and furthermore his militant stance towards Germany had awoken bitter resentment within the French Populace, from both the left and right. The legitimists had thrown their weight behind Boulanger, however Boulanger never acknowledged them as allies, undermining the prestige and popularity of the Monarchist movement of France.\n\nBoulanger however was arrested at the peak of his height, for charges of conspiracy and treason. Changes in the Electoral System were made to remedy the faults that allowed Boulanger’s rise to prominence, and thus Boulangerisme begun to decline as a movement, sentencing the French-left to subsequent decline as well. Coupled with this, the already discredited monarchist elements that supported Boulanger were met with another blow, as the Republicans had the French Crown Jewels broken up and sold off as to eliminate any rallying symbols for the monarchists to fall behind. Monarchism, alongside the radical French-left, had begun to decline into obscurity and irrelevance, ushering a period of Republican Conservative-Liberalism, which would dominate French politics for two decades."
fra.2.d:0 "However, whilst French politics began to solidify, French position globally had hardly remained sturdy. Diplomatic spats and conflicts with both Germany and Britain had spurred the two nations to band together against France. Colonial border incidents would intermediately crop up, worsening tensions between the three powers. France had begun to find herself outmatched diplomatically, and thus she was incentivized to find her own allies.\n\nIn 1904, France had founded the Triple Entente. The initial members being France herself, Italy, and Russia. All nations felt there was a mutual need for a counterweight to the Triple-Alliance of Britain, Germany and Austria-Hungary. However, the formation of the Triple-Entente had only guaranteed the outbreak of the Großerkrieg.\n\nIn 1905, the Maradi Crisis would break out, the final Colonial Conflict that would occur between France and Britain before the Großerkrieg. British Troops which had ventured into Maradi, a certified French territory, and then came into combat with French troops had served as the spark that would spurr on a new global conflict.\n\nTowards the end of the war, France had faced increasingly large portions of unrest on the homefront due to unrelenting blockades from both the British and German Navies. Rationing was introduced, much to the dismay of the populace. Living standards began to noticeably decline. Nonetheless, the French Military was capable of continuing to hold up their morale despite grueling conditions on the field.\n\nThe War formally came to an end on March 10th of 1910, with the signature of the Entente on the Treaty of Potsdam. France lost many territories in the process, including the Nancy-borderstrip on the mainland and countless other colonies overseas. France had immediately become swept up by national bitterness and instability, general dissatisfaction towards the Government for ‘losing’ the war had led to various groups of Nationalists and Revanchists leading protests and riots nationwide. A French Civil War looked to be a likely outcome for the country.\n\nInstead, the Assemblée Nationale had worked out another plan to avert such a Civil War. Whilst the Government was badly discredited, the Military had garnered large amounts of public admiration during the war, which would be attributed to their excellent performance on the front and grim, but nonetheless formidable morale. The Assemblée Nationale’s plan was to vote itself out of existence and allow Maurice Gamelin, a notable Republican, to establish a Military Dictatorship until a proper opportunity was to return in which he could restore Civilian Government."
fra.3.d:0 "This plan went into action in 1916, the Assemblée Nationale had voted itself out of existence, and Gamelin had immediately set up his Military Junta afterwards. Instability had quelled from the Nationalists and Revanchists, who had viewed the Military positively. However, the various democratic groups within France weren’t happy with the change in regime, despite it occuring voluntarily. Minor levels up unrest linger within French Society due to this.\n\nRegardless, Maxime Weygand caught onto these sentiments. Thus, he felt a compulsion to work out some form of compromise until Civilian Government would be restored, after his planned revenge against Germany. He instituted a basic set of policies that resulted in France transitioning from a Military Dictatorship to a Military Republic, with the most radical change being him allowing ‘elections’ in which members of the Military could vote in.\n\nThis move was met with mixed responses, soothing some of the more conservative-aligned political groups within France whilst simultaneously angering liberal political groups, who believed that Democratic Rights should be afforded to all citizens rather than solely Military Personnel, who weren’t entirely content with the regime to begin with.\n\nFrench intervention in the Italian Civil War in the 1920’s had allowed them to prop up a regime which was friendly to France, styled off the ‘Military Republic’ created by Maxime Weygand. This success had allowed Maxime Weygand to prove to the populace that he’d be able to eventually reassert the Dominance of France over Europe, and perhaps the world as a whole.\n\nNot-so-silent Rearmament would be a goal that France would pursue for the upcoming years, birthing a new type of militarism within French society. Today, France stands as one of the major powers in Europe despite her battered state, and is readily eager to oppose Germany once more, after domestic spats and unrest are solved of course."
